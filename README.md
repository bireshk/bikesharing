This could possibly because of heavy traffic jam on the road and office commute time could be easy with bike riding and hence bike sharing business could be an ideal in this type of environment. This business idea could be implemented in any other cities where the dynamics matches.

Two additional graphs can help to visualize if the business could be made more profitable:
1.	Fair/hour vs time – could the bike fair varies during pick hour
2.	Fair/hour vs weather – could the bike fair changes due to adverse weather
